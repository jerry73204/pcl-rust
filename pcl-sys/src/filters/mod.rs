//! FFI bindings for PCL filters
//!
//! This module provides low-level FFI bindings for PCL's filtering algorithms
//! including downsampling, outlier removal, and pass-through filtering.

// Note: Filter functions are defined in the main FFI bridge (crate::ffi)
// to ensure proper type compatibility with cxx.
