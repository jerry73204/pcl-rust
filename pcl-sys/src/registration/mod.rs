//! FFI bindings for PCL registration algorithms
//!
//! This module provides low-level FFI bindings for PCL's registration algorithms
//! including ICP (Iterative Closest Point) and NDT (Normal Distributions Transform).

// Note: Registration functions are defined in the main FFI bridge (crate::ffi)
// to ensure proper type compatibility with cxx.
