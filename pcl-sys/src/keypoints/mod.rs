//! FFI bindings for PCL keypoint detection algorithms
//!
//! This module provides low-level FFI bindings for PCL's keypoint detection algorithms
//! including Harris 3D, SIFT 3D, ISS (Intrinsic Shape Signatures), and other detectors.

// Note: Keypoints functions are defined in the main FFI bridge (crate::ffi)
// to ensure proper type compatibility with cxx.
