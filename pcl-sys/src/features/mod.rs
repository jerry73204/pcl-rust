//! FFI bindings for PCL feature extraction algorithms
//!
//! This module provides low-level FFI bindings for PCL's feature extraction algorithms
//! including normal estimation, FPFH, PFH, and other geometric descriptors.

// Note: Features functions are defined in the main FFI bridge (crate::ffi)
// to ensure proper type compatibility with cxx.
