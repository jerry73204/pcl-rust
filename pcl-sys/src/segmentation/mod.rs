//! FFI bindings for PCL segmentation algorithms
//!
//! This module provides low-level FFI bindings for PCL's segmentation algorithms
//! including region growing, RANSAC-based segmentation, and clustering algorithms.

// Note: Segmentation functions are defined in the main FFI bridge (crate::ffi)
// to ensure proper type compatibility with cxx.
